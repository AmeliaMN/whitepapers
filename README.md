## Data science white papers

As a consultant for [The Concord Consortium](https://concord.org/), I prepared several white papers and discussion seminars for the group. 

- [Data Science Moves - Some thoughts and provocations](DataScienceMoves.pdf) (September 2016) This white paper describes a general framework of "data science moves," analogous to the "stats moves" the CODAP group has been thinking of. The "moves" I chose to focus on are inspired by the [data science workflow diagram](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/intro.html) from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). I also brought in [KidPix](http://www.science.smith.edu/~amcnamara/blog/tools/2014/10/01/KidPix.html) as an example of contextual menus. For more on this white paper, you can see the [recorded webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxbdyfRj44I) from September 2016 where we discussed it. 

- [Statistical Simulations](StatisticalSimulations.pdf) (November 2017) This white paper breaks down simulations into two main categories:

- Simulations from a model to generate data under that model 
- Simulations from data to generate new samples, either
	- randomized or
	- bootstrapped

It focuses mostly on the second category, because that is what I consider to be more 'statistical' than 'probablistic.' For more on this white paper, see the [recorded webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSaf-ypkOcw) from December 2016 where we discussed it. 

- [Is reasoning about variability part of data science?](ReasoningAboutVariability.pdf) (October 2017) This webinar did not have a whitepaper, but rather slides, which are hosted here as a pdf or on [google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/106CxLP_83rTUKpAGZA9iUB_9zs-nLUFcpVErCgTrLWw/edit). I thought about different kinds of variability (within an attribute, errors in data, sample-to-sample variability, measurment error, modeling error, variability due to parameter choices) and discussed which I believe are parts of data science, and which are not. Again, for the full discussion see the [recorded webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5rb2g62jF4) from October 2017.
